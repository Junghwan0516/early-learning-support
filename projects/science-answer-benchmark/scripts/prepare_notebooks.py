**Question:** What does one record represent, and what data-quality issues must be understood before modelling?

This independent portfolio study examines public English science short answers. It starts from education experience and focuses on reproducible data inspection. One row represents an answer record, not a unique learner. This release contains data analysis only.

figures=[
('01_class_distribution','Class imbalance','Correct answers account for 40.41% of training records. A majority-class rule would achieve this training accuracy while missing every other class. The majority/minority count ratio is about 87.3; it is not a model result.'),
('02_domain_label_counts','Domain counts','Each cell is an answer-record count. Domain codes are retained from the source rather than expanded into unverified names.'),
('03_domain_label_shares','Within-domain shares','Each row sums to 100%. This removes domain sample-size differences but does not remove uncertainty from small domains. Read it alongside the counts.'),
('04_answer_length_ecdf','Answer-length distributions','Whitespace-separated word count is a transparent length measure. Each curve uses its own class denominator; the non-domain curve has only 23 records. The pooled median is 11 words.'),
('05_answer_length_boxplot','Length and outliers','The boxes summarize quartiles; points outside the whiskers are retained observations. No record is removed simply because it is long.'),
('06_reference_overlap','Reference-answer lexical overlap','Jaccard similarity equals the intersection divided by the union of lower-case word sets. Stop words are retained. Lexical overlap is not a semantic correctness score.'),
('07_question_sample_sizes','Unequal question contributions','Questions are ranked by answer count. This is not a time series. Unequal contributions motivate an additional question-weighted analysis.'),
('08_question_label_diversity','Question-level label diversity','Each point is a question. Entropy summarizes diversity in the observed labels, not latent student ability or a validated question-difficulty scale. Class share and entropy are derived from the same labels.'),
('09_minority_domain_distribution','Minority-class concentration','Counts and within-domain rates use different denominators. Non-domain records occur in 9 of the 12 training domains and 19 of the 135 questions.'),
('10_duplicate_structure','Repeated inputs','The left panel uses a log count axis so repeated groups remain visible. The right panel separates unique normalized inputs from excess repeated rows. Repetition can reflect independent submissions.'),
('11_label_conflicts','Conflicting annotations','Six normalized complete-input groups contain more than one label. Inspect the corresponding table before considering any relabelling; the release preserves all original labels.'),
('12_negation_markers','Negation markers','The listed words and contractions are lexical flags. Scientific contradiction can occur without them, and correct explanations can contain them. This indicator is not a contradiction classifier.'),
('13_answer_vs_question_weighting','Aggregation choices','Answer-weighted shares pool all records. Question-weighted shares average within-question shares with equal weight per question. Neither estimates a unique-student distribution.'),
('14_domain_reference_overlap','Overlap across domains','Domain differences may reflect vocabulary, references, questions, or annotation. This descriptive plot cannot identify which mechanism caused them.')]
